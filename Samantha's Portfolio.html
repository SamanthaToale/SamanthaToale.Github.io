		<h2 class="h2">InDesign</h2>
		<p>For this project I worked in a group with four other design students. Since we were doing this in the beginning of October, we made a Halloween Movie Calendar.

		<h2 class="h2">Photoshop</h2>
		<p>This was an individual project in which we were assigned to create a series of posters in Photoshop, utilizing AI for both text and image generation.

<div class="section">
	
		<h2 class="h2">Illustrator</h2>
		<p>This project was also individual, and required we create a branding package, including a logo and multiple variants, as well as a specific color palette and font list. This was the most intensive of the four projects.
