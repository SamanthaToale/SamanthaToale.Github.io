		<h2 class="h2_2">Canva</h2>
	<p class="description1">This was a group project in which we had to make a brochure or magazine and were instructed to use text and image AI generators to assist us. The Ida-Hope Cat Sanctuary that we designed this brochure for is not a real company, and is instead one that we made up for the sake of the project. This project was an exercise in page layout and visual balance, as we had a lot of information to pack into a tight space, and needed to be sure it would be pleasing to look at.
		<br>
		<br>Our team chose to use Canva for this project, due to it's easy team sharing capabilities. With each member of the team assigned a different part of the project, I focused primarily on the color scheme, working with AI such as ChatGPT and color palette generators to find something that would create strong visual appeal and establish a recognizable brand.

	<p class="description2">This was also a group project, and the first project in which I began using Adobe products. We were assigned to create a document, or series of documents, utilizing InDesign. Seeings as it was the beginning of October, my team decided to create a Halloween Movie countdown calendar. This included a cover page, two different calendars (hardcore horror and family-friendly), as well as pages with the descriptions and ratings of each movie.
		<br>
		<br>After creating a project plan, we divided the project across the group, and my assignment was the design of the cover page pictured to the left. Adobe's InDesign proved to be a challenging learning curve, but became fun once I became comfortable with the software and tools. I referenced existing calendar designs for inspiration, hoping to use sidebars and whitespace to my advantage to create a clean and professional design.

		<h2 class="h2_2">Photoshop</h2>
  <p class="p">An individual project, this was the first time I was using Adobe independantly. Having prior experience with Photoshop, this program did not prove to be as difficult as InDesign. The assignment was to make a series of posters for anything we'd like, so long as it was applicable to our real lives. I had a lot of fun making the three posters pictured below. I spent a great deal of time curating the color scheme, picking the fonts, and making consistent iconography before beginning the actual posters. For each poster I relied heavily on AI image generation, including Photoshop's generative fill to expand the background and make minor adjustments. I had the most difficulty when trying to maintain the visual balance of the posters and allow the white space to breathe so that the design didn't feel overly cluttered. In the end, I am very proud of how they all turned out.

		<h2 class="h2_2">Illustrator</h2>
	<p class="p">By far the most complex of the four projects, it was also the most fun! Working independantly, I was tasked with creating a complete branding package for a company of my choosing. I decided to create my own company: A fictional Cat Café located in Rexburg, Idaho. As a cat and over-all animal lover myself, I had a lot of fun sketching over a dozen logo designs before translating them into Illustrator. I created four logos. The first is in full color and serves as the primary logo for the company. The second is the monochromatic varient for simple printing. The third is by far my favorite, offering a different shape for the logo. The fourth is the most dynamic of them all. 
		<br>
		<br>I spent the first couple hours of this project sketching dozens of possible logos, exploring all possibilities. Some of my ideas that I liked, but ultimately scrapped, included highlighting disabled and special needs cats in the branding, kittens interacting with various café items, and intricate latte art. Each of these logos were free-handed using the pen and anchor tools, and took a great deal of finessing to get just right.
