	<p>Born in the Bay Area and raised in Stockton, I am a California girl through-and-through! I spent two and a half years at San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton, CA, where I graduated in the Fall of 2022 and earned my Associate's Degree in English. I have since transferred to BYU-Idaho, where I have been since January 2023, and am working on my Bachelor's in English with emphases on Creative Writing and Professional Writing. 
		<br>
		<br>In 2023, my short story "To Watch the Snow Fall" was published in the October issue of <a href="https://austurmagazine.com/themagazine" target="_blank" class="Magazine">Austur Magazine</a>, a Christian magazine based in Utah, and my story "Sea Glass" was published in <a href="https://www.byui.edu/english/student-opportunities/outlet#outlets-origins" target="_blank" class="Magazine">Outlet</a>, the student art and literature magazine at BYU-Idaho.
		<br>
		<br>Recently, I have begun exploring other avenues in which I can develop and apply my written and visual communication skills, specifically through learning and using different forms of digital design, including using various Adobe programs.</p>
